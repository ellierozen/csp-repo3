### PBL Unit 1 / Week 10
- library is a collection of pre-written code, functions, and modules that extend the language's capabilities
- These libraries are designed to be reused by developers to perform common tasks, rather than having to write the code from scratch. 
- Libraries are essential for simplifying and accelerating the development process, as they provide a wide range of tools and functions for various purposes.
- Modules: Libraries in Python consist of modules, which are individual Python files containing functions, classes, and variables related to a specific set of tasks or a particular domain. You can import these modules into your own Python code to access their functionality.
- Standard Library: Python comes with a comprehensive standard library that includes modules for various tasks, such as working with files, networking, data processing, and more. These modules are readily available and do not require installation.
- Third-party Libraries: In addition to the standard library, there is a vast ecosystem of third-party libraries created by the Python community. These libraries cover a wide range of domains, including web development, data analysis, machine learning, game development, and more. Some popular third-party libraries include NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, TensorFlow, Django, Flask, and many others.
