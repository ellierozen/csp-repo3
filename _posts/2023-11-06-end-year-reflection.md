### PBL Unit 1 / Week 12
Because I took CSA last year I had something to compare this first trimester to which was nice. The pacing of the course is very similar, however I feel like we had much time this tri to work on passion projects compared to other tri's. I'm not sure if this was because we had a sub for the first couple weeks or it was like this for all classes, but it was a little stressful towards the end. I did think the team teaching was a cool addition since in CSA this only occured 3rd tri and was solely about college board topics. I do wish we had a little more tech talks instead of team teaches about apis and databases so that they could've been better implemented in the passion project. Overall, though, I think this was a good first trimester.
