# 1.4 1 errors 
logic error- mistake that causese it to behave incorrectly or unexpectedly 6
syntax error- mistake in program where rules of programming language arent found
	- common errors 
	- missig colons, parenthesis, brackets
run-time error - mistake in programming that occurs during execution of prorgam - languages degine their own runtime erors
	 - aka a bug 
	 - ex : dividing by zero, wrong entered data type 
overflow error - occurs when a computer attemtos to handle a number outside of the defined range 
	- asking program to do something it cant 

- part of the programming process 

# 1.4 2 correcting errors 
- test cases
- hand tracing 
	- writing value of variables within the loop to determine if output is correct
- visualizations
	- visual graphs
- debuggers 
	- use software designed to run a program and be paused at points
- adding extra output statements
	- used to find the error but removed after
	- simialr to tracing but more computer work

# 1.4 3 testing and expecting output 
- programmers think about testing at the start of the development 
- refines and improves program
