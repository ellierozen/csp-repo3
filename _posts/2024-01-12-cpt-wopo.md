# Water Polo Guide 
- Inspired by Ellie's passion for her sport water polo we decided to create a guide for all clueless parents and spectators 
- The frontend design is simple and easy to use for the quick mid game searches 

# AI Feature 
- As a water polo player, Ellie is aware of the intricate rules that are a part of the game 
- The basis of the information will come from AI which will provide with the info
- IE: you ask "why did the ref blow the whistle and the ball was given to the other players" and the AI will respond with what the rule is/what this means in water polo 

## Login Feature
- Local games often go unreported on the few sites available (maxpreps)
- To combat this we will have a login feature where you create your account and you are able to report the local games scores

## Roles 
### Ellie - Backend - responsible for login and also helping with frontend design 
### Katelyn - Frontend/Scrum Master - Create design and all frontned 
### Ishraq- DevOps - will help with connecting login and AI
