-  Algorithms are step-by-step procedures or sets of rules used to solve problems or perform tasks
    - Also known as sequencing
        - Step 1, Step 2, Step 3...(in order)
        - Ex: putting on clothes one at a time in the morning, washing dishes, etc.
- Selection
    - Decision to make based on a given circumstance
        - Ex: is it raining? If so, bring an umbrella outside
- Iteration
    - Also referred to as repetition
    - After performing steps of a procedure/problem, iteration means checking to see if a task is completed
        - Refers back accordingly
- Algorithms can be represented using flowcharts, Pseudo Code, or programming languages
- Conditional statements
    - Conditional statements (if-else statements) allow a program to make decisions based on certain conditions
    - Enable different code branches to be executed depending on whether a condition is true or false
- Loops
    - Loops (for loops, while loops) enable repetitive execution of code
    - They are used when a set of instructions needs to be repeated multiple times.
- Strings
    - A string is a data type used to represent text or sequences of characters
    - Strings are commonly used in programming for tasks like input/output and text processing
