# Tri 2 Individual Review

## My project
The project we chose deals with water polo and is called the "ultimate water polo guide". Since I play water polo I felt very connected to this project which I think added the passion aspect to a passion project. We made this guide in hopes of people being able to easier understand the complex sport of water polo.

## College board video requirments versus my video

## My contributions 
My role as backend entailed me creating the stats database, the ai feature, the signup and login, and the scoreboard. During this process there were definetely times of frustration but the satisfication of finishing it was worth it. It was interesting to work with open ai because I had never attempted to use its api which was a good learning moment for me. 

## Additions/Future Plans
I would like to incorporate the user id in the adding score process where you can put the number of the player who scored, which would in turn automatically update the statistics as according to the user id. Overall though I am very happy with how the project turned out and the work that I put in.
