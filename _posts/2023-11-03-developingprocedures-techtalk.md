### PBL Unit 1 / Week 10
2 Main Types of Procedures:
- Procedure that returns a value of data
- Procedure that executes a block of statements
- Procedure Parameters: variables that are defined within the procedure's parentheses and serve as placeholders for values that can be passed to the procedure when it is called, allowing the procedure to operate on different data or values each time it is executed.
- Procedure Algorithms: a step-by-step set of instructions that defines a specific task or operation to be performed within a computer program
- Procedure Return Values: data or results that a procedure can send back to the part of the program that called it, allowing the procedure to provide information or perform a specific task and then share the outcome with the rest of the program.
