Program A prints 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10. Program B initializes i to 0. Inside the loop, it increments i and then prints i. The loop terminates when i equals 10, which occurs after 10 is printed. Program B prints 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10.\n",

    "- collegeboard:  It will first call TrimRight to remove the four rightmost characters (the file extension). It will then pass the result to TrimLeft, which will remove the eleven leftmost characters (the date tag), leaving only the desired description. Statement II is incorrect. It will first call TrimRight to remove the eleven rightmost characters, which includes more than just the file extension. It will then pass the result to TrimLeft to remove the four leftmost characters, which does not remove the entire date tag. Statement III is correct. It will first call TrimLeft to remove the eleven leftmost characters (the date tag). It will then pass the result to TrimRight, which will remove the four rightmost characters (the file extension), leaving only the desired description."

    "Overall this MC made me feel pretty confident in my csp skills. These MC are very diffrerent from the CSA ones that I had to do last year, which were all either following code and saying what the output would be, fixing code, and just very java orieneted. I think I have an upperhand because I took CSA last year so I am familiar with a lot of the basics. Its also interesting how some of the CSP questions are kind of common knowledge. For example, it asks about how to help the digital divide and the answers are very obvious. All in all, I am happy with my performance on the MC and feel pretty good about it. "
